# Week-04 A3 and GDPR

### Exercise 1
The first thing we will do is to look at Cesarean rotation. I am not sure it was ever used, but it is good for making text which can't be read by the named eye, but is easy to crack.

In the sample code, find out how many letters to rotate the hidden message. Notice, the rotator can rotate both forwards and backwards (though that is not really necessary - why?)

### Exercise 2
This exercise uses an "incredible dumb and stupid" password scheme, as the actual input is a number between 1000 and 9999. You must find out which one. Your attack form here is brute force (trying them all).

Hint: If you want to automate validation, the word "everything" occurs in the original text.

### Exercise 3
This exercise is about writing a small toy editor which allow you to store small texts in encrypted format. The save function is there, but you have to write the load.
